Therefore, if a new-hire came in on their first active date,  they wouldn't be in Lenel yet.  This has been fixed.\r\n \r\nContractor Expiration Dates:\r\nThe deactivation dates for contractors cannot be fed to the Lenel deactivation date field until a badge has already been issued.  Unfortunately, after a badge has been issued, there is not a subsequent feed to update/insert the deactivation date – until there is a change in that person's Workday record which causes a subsequent feed for that person to be sent – at which time the deactivation field can be updated.\r\nSolution:  Dean will create a new field in Lenel.  When a new-hire is added, the Workday feed will populate the deactivation date to this new field.  However, this is not the true deactivation field that controls when the badge deactivates.  Therefore, when a Security representative issues the badge to the new-hire, they will take the deactivation date that had been fed to this new field and manually enter it into the real  deactivation date field.  Since a badge will have already issued, subsequent changes/extensions of contractor end dates will be fed to the proper deactivation date field.   The new field will be implemented at the next maintenance window. \r\n \r\nNew Fields\r\nThree additional new fields are needed in Lenel.  (1) Manager level – already being sent by Workday, just needs a field in Lenel to display it. (2) Job Code, and (3) Supplier Field.  LaTonia will arrange to add these fields to the feed, and Dean will create the three new fields in Lenel.
